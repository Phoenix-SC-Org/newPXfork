                    <li><strong className="text-sky-400">[Maintenance]</strong> <strong className="font-semibold text-slate-100">Fresh foundations.</strong> I updated the underlying libraries the platform is built on to their current, best-supported versions, and reworked the parts of the code that needed it so everything fits the newer versions cleanly. None of this changes what you see or do day to day — it keeps the foundation current and secure, and makes the project easier to look after going forward.</li>
                    <li><strong className="text-sky-400">[Security]</strong> <strong className="font-semibold text-slate-100">Another security pass, layer by layer.</strong> I went back through the platform once more as a defence-in-depth review and tightened a broad set of access, validation, and data-handling checks. As with the passes before it, almost none of this is visible in everyday use — the point is simply that information and actions stay with the people they are meant for. Tests were added to keep it that way.</li>

                    <VersionCard version="15.1.5-open" title="Privacy & Access Hardening">
                        <li><strong className="text-sky-400">[Security]</strong> <strong className="font-semibold text-slate-100">This one was about privacy and keeping authority where it belongs.</strong> A restricted unit's voice room is now as private as its text channel, so only its members can drop in and listen. Added additional verification backstop before RSI handle is stamped as verified. Running the government can no longer be turned into a way to quietly hand yourself one of the top seats, only an admin can fill those. Nothing looks different in daily use, and I wired in tests to keep it that way.</li>
                        <li><strong className="text-sky-400">[Security]</strong> <strong className="font-semibold text-slate-100">Tighter internal data handling.</strong> I brought the data layer in line with the hosted version. Every database read now asks for exactly the fields it needs instead of pulling whole rows. This is the gate and scope work done for the hosted version, and in this case is defence in depth downstream. This ensures that a column added to the database later can't quietly flow somewhere it should not.</li>
                        <li><strong className="font-semibold text-slate-100">Application spam is capped.</strong> Recruitment and job applications now have a sensible per-person limit, the same job can't be applied to twice, and a flood of them can no longer bury the HR team in notifications.</li>
                        <li><strong className="font-semibold text-slate-100">For self-hosters.</strong> There are database changes in this release, so re-run schema.sql in your Supabase SQL editor once you have updated. It is safe to run more than once.</li>

                    <VersionCard version="15.1.4-open" title="Security Hardening">
                        <li><strong className="text-sky-400">[Security]</strong> <strong className="font-semibold text-slate-100">Another security pass, and a review that went looking for ways to break in.</strong> A few things came up and I fixed them. A partnered org can no longer take over a joint operation you are sharing with them. The RSI handle check can no longer be fooled into linking a handle you do not own. Starting or cancelling a service request now stays with the people actually on it. And a sign-in now stays valid for about a day instead of a week, so a stolen session stops working much sooner. None of this changes how the app works from day to day. I added tests so it stays that way.</li>
                        <li><strong className="font-semibold text-slate-100">Safer if you do not run a proxy.</strong> Rate limiting and abuse blocking used to assume there was a reverse proxy sitting in front of the app. They now work correctly on their own, so a plain setup is protected with no extra config. If you do put a proxy in front, set TRUST_PROXY_HOPS to how many there are so the app sees each visitor's real address.</li>
                        <li><strong className="font-semibold text-slate-100">For self-hosters.</strong> This one touches the database. After updating, re-run schema.sql in your Supabase SQL editor. Running it again is safe.</li>

                    <VersionCard version="15.1.3-open" title="Access Hardening">
                        <li><strong className="text-sky-400">[Security]</strong> <strong className="font-semibold text-slate-100">A small round of hardening.</strong> I brought a handful of improvements across from the hosted version. The main one: when an admin revokes someone's sessions or removes their account, that now takes effect right away for reading data too, not just for making changes. Around it are some quieter safeguards — a person's clearance can only be changed through the proper, logged path; an extra safety net keeps any future secret setting from ever reaching the browser; and a few list and search queries were tidied up. It is all invisible day to day; the point is that access stays with the people it is meant for. Tests were added to keep it that way.</li>
                        <li><strong className="font-semibold text-slate-100">For self-hosters.</strong> This is a code-only update. There are no database changes, so you do not need to re-run schema.sql for this update.</li>

                    <VersionCard version="15.1.2-open" title="Sign-In Fix">
                        <li><strong className="text-sky-400">[Fix]</strong> <strong className="font-semibold text-slate-100">Discord sign-in fix.</strong> The hardening in 15.1.1 added a server-side safety check to the sign-in handshake, but the app was handing that handshake back in a slightly different shape than the check expected, so it could turn people away when they tried to log in with Discord. This release lines the two halves back up, so sign-in completes normally again with the new protection still fully in place, and adds a test so the two can't quietly drift apart again. Thanks to witherfork from the community for spotting and providing a fix.</li>

                        <li><strong className="text-sky-400">[Security]</strong> <strong className="font-semibold text-slate-100">Another round of hardening.</strong> I worked back through the platform and tightened a wide range of access and validation checks across operations, intel, the marketplace, alliance sharing, and sign-in and session handling. This closed a number of edge cases found in a deep review. Almost all of it is invisible day to day; the point is that data and actions stay with the people they are meant for. Tests were added to keep it that way. These reflect improvements made in the hosted version of myrsi.org since the release of 15.1.0-open</li>

                        <li><strong className="text-sky-400">[Security]</strong> <strong className="font-semibold text-slate-100">Another security pass.</strong> I went back through the platform again and tightened the checks on who can see what across operations, intelligence, HR, the marketplace, and alliance sharing. Most of this is invisible day to day, which is the point: information only ever reaches the people it is meant to. Appropriate tests have been wired in.</li>
                        <li><strong className="font-semibold text-slate-100">Operation templates now respect clearance.</strong> A template saved from a classified operation now inherits that operation's clearance, so its plan can only be seen and reused by people cleared for it, not everyone in the org.</li>

One deployment runs one organisation — bring your own Supabase project and Discord application, drop in your environment config, and a polished first-run setup wizard walks you from a preflight environment check through Discord sign-in, the one-time admin claim code, RSI handle verification, and an optional import of your existing data. The first Discord login that redeems the console setup code becomes Admin.</li>
                        <li><strong className="font-semibold text-slate-100">A personal note.</strong> This release is my soft close on MyRSI. It is not the final update and I am not disappearing, but it marks the point where I step back from the day to day. I wanted to leave the platform in the best and safest state I could, and to make sure none of you are ever locked in. Here is what that looks like.</li>
                        <li><strong className="font-semibold text-slate-100">Warrants are now Caution Notes.</strong> Same feature, friendlier name. It flags people your organisation should be wary of and shows a clear warning on any service request that involves them. The old labels are gone, replaced with three simple levels: Caution, High Caution, and Extreme Caution.</li>
                        <li><strong className="font-semibold text-slate-100">Security and privacy came first.</strong> After the security incident some of you saw earlier, I went back through the entire platform from top to bottom reviewing any point at which data is transacted. This was the single biggest part of the release.</li>
                        <li><strong className="font-semibold text-slate-100">MyRSI is now open source.</strong> The platform is free and open for anyone to read, run, and build on. The full source for the self hosted version lives at <a href="https://github.com/MyRSI-org/open-myrsi-org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-sky-300 hover:text-sky-200 underline">github.com/MyRSI-org/open-myrsi-org</a>. If you ever want to host your own copy or just see how everything works under the hood, it is all there. Your org owner can export your full organisation's data from the billing portal at any time to take it with you.</li>
                        <li><strong className="font-semibold text-slate-100">Reliability and tidy up.</strong> I fixed a range of behind the scenes issues that could trip up sign in or pages, made the app much clearer when something goes wrong, and removed a few older tools that were no longer needed.</li>
                        <li><strong className="font-semibold text-slate-100">Thank you.</strong> Trusting me with your organisations has genuinely meant a lot. The lights stay on, the code is yours, and I am still around. Fly safe.</li>
